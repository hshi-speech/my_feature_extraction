# my_feature_extraction
I have add some feature extraction function for torchaudio. 
waveform -> spectrogram(original codes) 
spectrogram -> fbank(modified)
fbank -> mfcc(modified)

magnitude spectrogram + phase spectrogram -> waveform (modifed)

They can be easily used in online speech enhancement systems to do the feature extraction.
